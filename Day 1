Today was the first lesson in Phyton Bootcamp , I have learned many new things . In general about Phyton, its variables , functions-  print, input, len().
these are some rules for variable names:
1. Make sure your variable names are descriptive
2.Dont have spaces between words
3.Dont start with numbers
4.Don't use special words like print or input
5.Choose simple words THAT ARE LESS LIKELy to become typos
6.Check the company style guidelines if you start work at a company

\n - is used to start a new line 
space sensitive, so for example if we put space before the start of print it will show the error
