Today I have learned about If, elif, else statements. I did some practical coding exercises - but I need to learn how to download from PyCharm to Github if possible.
I found this "if elif and else" statements are so important and useful for creating programs.
Its important to pay attention to the punctuatians and to the spaces. if and else statements are equal statements - so they are always in the same level. all the conditions under them.
I have also learned about Modulo . It was very new for me , since i have never used that before.
