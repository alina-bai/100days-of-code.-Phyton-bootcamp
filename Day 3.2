Today I have practiced a lot with coding. I did 2 small projects for: Roller coaster and Pizza deliveries.
I have spend some time  trying to figure out how to load those projects from PyCharm to Github but it wasn't successfull. I hope I will learn it soon. 
now I will just copy the code itself here:

Project: Python Pizza

bill = 0
print("Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!")
size = input("What size pizza do you want? S, M or L: ")
if size == "S":
    bill = 15
elif size =="M":
    bill = 20
elif size == "L":
    bill =25
else:
    print("You typed the wrong the letter")
pepperoni = input("Do you want pepperoni on your pizza? Y or N: ")
if pepperoni == "Y":
    if size == "S":
       bill += 2
    else:
       bill += 3
extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra cheese? Y or N: ")
if extra_cheese == "Y":
    bill += 1

print(f"Your final bill is: ${bill}.")



project:  Rollercoaster
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
bill = 0

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster")
    age = int(input("What is your age? "))
    if age <= 12:
        bill = 5
        print("Please pay $5.")
    elif age <= 18:
        bill = 7
        print("Please pay $7.")
    else:
        bill = 12
        print("Please pay $12.")

    wants_photo = input("Would you like to have a photo? Type y for Yes and n for No.")
    if wants_photo == "y":
        bill += 3

    print (f"Your final bill is $ {bill}")


else:
    print("Sorry you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
